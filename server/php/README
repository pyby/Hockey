Server Requirements:
- PHP 5.x
- https paths link on same resources as http

About:
- This server part is required for handling update requests by the client framework
- The server part can also be used without the client. It provides a web interface which beta testers can use to install the latest AdHoc provisioning profile and also the latest beta version via Safari right from the device.
- It can handle multiple applications via different bundle identifiers (I highly suggest using different bundle identifiers for Debug, AdHoc Beta and AppStore release builds !!!)
- The web interface is optimized for all device types (desktop computer, iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, iOS4 and iOS3)


Installation PHP Server:
- Copy the content of the public subfolder into a publicly accessible directory on your web server
- Copy the content of the includes subfolder into a publicly not accessible directory (for security) on your web server
- Adjust the relative path to the file main.php in the includes subfolder in public/_hockey/config.php and in public/proxy.php
- Adjust the absolute path to htpasswd file in public/_template_folder/.htaccess and in public/demo/.htaccess
- Depend of your server, make sure that the user who excutes the php code has write access on includes/proxylist.txt, public/_template_folder/stats/ and on public/demo/stats/
- Done

Comment for Installation :
- public/demo/ is a demo store, wih a fake IPA file. Create your own one, with the client demonstration Xcode project
- User access is demo / demo
- Admin access, to see statistics, is admin / admin

How to add a new store:
- Duplicate the public/_template_folder and rename it as you want (ie: mystore)
- Create an htpasswd in includes (ie: includes/htpassword_mystore) 
- Adjust the htaccess in the store to point to the htpasswd (ie: public/mystore/.htaccess points to include/htpassword_mystore)
- Depend of your server, make sure that the user who excutes the php code has write access on the stats folder (ie: public/mystore/stats/)
- Adjust the admin list of users in the stats/adminlist.txt file (ie: public/mystore/stats/adminlist.txt)

Comment when adding a new store :
- Duplicate all the content of public/_template_folder, includes hidden file like .htaccess
- The store is available at /public/?mystore (with or without secure access, http or https)

How to add a new application version:
- Create a subdirectory with the bundle identifier string as the name on the server (if it does not exist yet)
- Copy the provisioning profile into that subdirectory, it is important to have the extension ".mobileprovision" (mandatory file)
- Start XCode
- Invoke "Build and Archive"
- Open the Organizer
- Choose "Archived Applications"
- Select the build you want to publish
- Select "Share application"
- Select "Distribute for Enterprise..."
- Fill out the URL field and type "__URL__" (important !!)
- Enter a title, this will be shown in the web interface and on the client
- Version number will be taken automatically from the generated plist file
- Note: Do not enter a link to the app icon in the organizer screen. Hockey will add that part into the PList automatically on the server, if there is a PNG file found (114pixel icons work on all devices!)
- Note: The client does not check if the version number is actually a bigger number, it only checks if they are different, which should be fine anyway
- Save it, two files will be saved, one .plist and one .ipa
- Upload the plist file into the subdirectory on the server, it is important to have the extension ".plist" (mandatory)
- Upload the application file into the subdirectory on the server, it is important to have the extension ".ipa" (mandatory)
- If you want to web interface to show the app icon, upload the icon (.png format and extension required) into the subdirectory on the server, it is important to have an extension ".ipa" (optional)
- If you don't want this application to appear in the web interface, add a file named "private" (optional)
- If you want to add release information to the web interface and the client, add a file with the extension ".html" which contains the release information as HTML (without header and body)
- Note: Only the extensions of each file type are important, and only the first one found by PHP will be used!
- Note: If one of the mandatory files do not exist in the directory, the update or installation will not be made available
